      <p><strong>Last Updated:</strong> April 04, 2025</p>
      <p>
        At Trapo, I, Ifeanyi Christain, am committed to protecting your privacy
        and ensuring a safe experience while using my website and services. This
        Privacy and Safety Policy explains how I collect, use, and safeguard
        your information, as well as the measures I take to maintain a secure
        environment.
      </p>

      <h2>1. Information I Collect</h2>
      <ul>
        <li>
          <strong>Personal Information:</strong> Name, email address, phone
          number, or other details you provide when contacting me or engaging my
          services.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Project-Related Information:</strong> Files, content, or
          specifications you share for graphics design or software development
          projects.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Usage Data:</strong> Non-personal information such as IP
          addresses, browser type, and pages visited, collected automatically
          when you access my website.
        </li>
      </ul>

      <h2>2. How I Use Your Information</h2>
      <ul>
        <li>
          Provide and improve my graphics design and software development
          services.
        </li>
        <li>Communicate with you regarding projects, inquiries, or updates.</li>
        <li>Process payments and fulfill contractual obligations.</li>
        <li>Enhance website functionality and user experience.</li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        I will not use your information for purposes beyond what is necessary to
        deliver my services unless I have your explicit consent.
      </p>

      <h2>3. How I Protect Your Information</h2>
      <ul>
        <li>
          <strong>Data Security:</strong> I implement reasonable technical and
          organizational measures to safeguard your personal information from
          unauthorized access, loss, or misuse.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Limited Access:</strong> Only I, Ifeanyi Christain, will
          access your data unless third-party involvement (e.g., payment
          processors) is required, and only with strict confidentiality
          agreements.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Encryption:</strong> Sensitive data, where applicable, is
          transmitted securely using industry-standard encryption methods.
        </li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        Despite these efforts, no online system is 100% secure, and I cannot
        guarantee absolute security.
      </p>

      <h2>4. Sharing Your Information</h2>
      <ul>

          parties.

        <li>
          Information may be shared with trusted service providers (e.g.,
          hosting services, payment gateways) solely to facilitate my services.
          These providers are bound to maintain confidentiality.
        </li>
        <li>
          I may disclose information if required by law or to protect my rights,
          safety, or property.
        </li>
      </ul>
